# Mysidard’s Gemlog

Hello everyone and welcome to my Gemlog. This little “corner of ramblings” will contain posts of various length and quality and about various topics.  There is not going to be a general theme to this Gemlog; rather, I will be posting about things I find interesting at a particular moment. 

If I am working on a particular subject and want to compile some notes and information on that subject, you will find information about that in a Notes section I will be adding to the homepage as I see fit.
