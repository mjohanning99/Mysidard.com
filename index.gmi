# Welcome to Mysidard.com

Hello weary Gemini traveller and welcome to my capsule on the Geminispace. I have several presences on the regular web, but for the sake of keeping them separated, I am not going to mention these here. Instead, I have created this space as a personal hub for my various different hobbies and interests and hope you will find the information I will be sharing hereon helpful or interesting in some form. 


## About
=> about/aboutme.gmi    🐦 About Me
If you want to find out more about me, this page will hopefully satisfy your curiosity; beware, however, that my interests are rather varied and often change depending on my mood and the page might, therefore, be appended from time to time to reflect my current interests.

## Gemlog
=> gemlog/public/index.gmi 💎My Gemlog
This contains my gemlog, the Gemini version of a blog. On here, I will be posting about various topics that interest me, so be sure to check out the About Me page to find out what that might be.

## Links
