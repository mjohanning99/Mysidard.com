# To-Do List
I am planning on writing a few services that will make HTTP-only sites available via Gemini and I am also planning on writing a few of my own things. This will probably take a while but here is a list of things I am planning on doing.

☒ Writing a Hacker News proxy

## Non-Proxies
☐ Search engine
