# About the Server
Here you will find some information about the server that is running this capsule.

## Hardware
This server is running on a very cheap VPS with a very minimal amount of CPU power, RAM and space. I have a handful of other servers that run my other websites, but I decided it would be best for me to have my own server for my capsule on Geminispace. 

## Software
I am currently running Debian 11 with Bliz as my Gemini server and Kineto as my Gemini-to-HTTPS proxy. Check out my Gemlog if you want to find out more about both of these; I can especially recommend Bliz!
