# About Me

I am Mysidard — which is, obviously, not my real name — and I am a German in his twenties. I am currently working (as of Wednesday, January 26th 2022) at a small company located in North Western Germany and I am both the project leader for our LoRaWAN — which is supposed to become the first extensive LoRaWAN in the entirety of Germany — project and I also work in customer support. 

##💻 Technology
I work a lot with and on computers in my free time as well. I like tinkering with hardware and software and mostly use macOS or Linux to do so, though my main machine is an M1 Mac Mini. I like setting things up the way I like them and have been installing various apps and tweaks to make my Mac run just the way I want it to (tiling windows rock!). I have also recently acquired a Magic TrackPad, but I tend to use trackball mice with computers other than my Mac.

I also run a small website on the regular Web which has been averaging roughly five visitors daily as of late — quite an achievement for me. I am in the process of — very slowly — learning the Nim programming language and have experience in PHP and Ruby as well.

##🈚️ Languages 
I also love learning languages. I have, over the course of my life, learnt countless languages with varying success rates. My main problem is the fact that I quickly become “bored” with the language I am learning and decide to move on to another one rather rapidly. Therefore, out of the dozen or so languages that I have previously attempted to study, I can only actually speak German (my native language), English and Swedish to a conversational level.

I am also somewhat proficient in Ancient Greek — and have actually published my own translation of an Ancient Greek text already. This is the language I am focussing on the most at present and about which I will most likely speak on my capsule as well. The language I will probably start learning next is Tagalog, as that is my boyfriend’s native language.

##📷 Photography
I am also a fan of photography and take photos of virtually everything I find intruiging. As I don’t want to carry my camera — an EOS M100 — around with me all the time, I’ve decided to buy the new Pixel 6, as its camera is absolutely astonishing for a phone’s. This allows me to take DSLR-quality photos wherever I am without the need of carrying around my M100 with me everywhere I go. I do, however, prefer shooting with my M100 and my f/1.8 lens.

##🍷 Drinks
Wines, teas and coffees are also a hobby of mine; I like trying out different kinds of these drinks and analysing them — though the latter is not part of my regular routine but rather something I do only on special occasions (when buying a particularly expensive variety of coffee, tea or wine, for instance). 

##🦜 Birds
I really, really like birds and I am not sure what else to add here. I am currently reading a handful of books about them and will almost certainly add information about various interesting birds and their behaviour to this website in the coming days and months. You may also find bird ASCII art or bird emoji plastered around my caspule seemingly at random because why not? Birb is fun.

##📖 Entertainment
I love science fiction and crime. My favourite shows are Star Trek (basically all of them except the new ones), Babylon 5, Star Gate SG1 and Star Gate Atlantis. I also love reading science fiction books, though have been having to cut down on reading books as of late due to my being a bit busy with work and school and upcoming exam stress. My favourites are RAMA, The Three Body Problem, The Fountains of Paradise, A Mission of Gracity … I am sure you get the general picture.

I also watch Anime from time to time and really liked Shin Seiki Evangelion. I have also watched Brand New Animal and was quite a fan of that too (mostly because it has a cute Tanuki girl, but that’s beside the point).

Listening to music is also something I enjoy greatly, even though my taste in music is rather strange. I listen to a lot of Vaporwave, 70s-90s (Finnish music from that area especially), synthwave and other types of electronic music (Klaus Schulze is really nice), music from the DPRK and tonnes of other stuff. 

Playing games is another thing I spend my time on, though I don’t play games nearly as often as I used to anymore. When I do play games nowadays, I mostly play adventure games (Starship Titanic, Myst, Quern, Shivers). 

I also very much like creating AI-generated art using programs like VQGAN+CLIP. I have a rather nice computer to do this with, as it has an 8 GB NVIDIA QUADRO M5000 graphics card which is just enough to create somewhat decently-sized images (just under 500x500).
